### What I learned

I used this project as a small learning project to develop my React skills. The ProductCard component embraces the component paradigm and can be reused with any other products or descriptions and pricing. The data is flowed to the component from the App.js global component. This information could easily come from some JSON source and be configurable for any other products that might need to be displayed.
